# Introduction to AWS Cloud

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of cloud services that help businesses and individuals build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”). Instead of owning physical infrastructure, users can rent computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
