# AWS CI/CD

AWS CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is a set of DevOps practices that automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC) using AWS services. It enables faster, reliable, and scalable application delivery by automating build, test, and deployment processes.

## Key AWS CI/CD Services

### 1. AWS CodeCommit
A fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories, allowing teams to collaborate on code securely.

### 2. AWS CodeBuild
A fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts.

### 3. AWS CodeDeploy
Automates application deployments to Amazon EC2, Lambda, and on-premises servers with minimal downtime.

### 4. AWS CodePipeline
A continuous integration and deployment service that automates the release process by integrating CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

### 5. AWS CodeArtifact
A managed service for storing and retrieving software packages securely, supporting various package formats.

### 6. AWS CodeStar
A unified dashboard that simplifies software development and integrates AWS CI/CD services.

## Benefits of AWS CI/CD
- **Faster Deployment**: Automates the entire deployment pipeline.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing ensures fewer bugs in production.
- **Scalability**: Easily adapts to changing business needs.
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Automates repetitive tasks, reducing human intervention.

## AWS CI/CD Workflow
1. **Code Commit**: Developers push code to AWS CodeCommit.
2. **Build & Test**: AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests the code.
3. **Deploy**: AWS CodeDeploy rolls out the application to production.
4. **Pipeline Orchestration**: AWS CodePipeline automates the end-to-end process.

Using AWS CI/CD, teams can accelerate software delivery, reduce deployment risks, and ensure higher application stability with automation-driven workflows.
